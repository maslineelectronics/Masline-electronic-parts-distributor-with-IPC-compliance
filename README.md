## Electronic Parts Distributor with IPC Compliance

As a leading **electronic parts distributor**, Masline integrates IPC standards into every aspect of its operations from supplier validation and inspection procedures to packaging and traceability. The adherence to IPC guidelines ensures consistent performance and durability across the entire supply chain.

### What IPC Compliance Means

IPC, originally known as the Institute for Printed Circuits, defines global standards for the design, production, and testing of electronic assemblies and components. IPC compliance guarantees that every part meets specific quality metrics such as:
- Solder joint integrity
- Material reliability
- Moisture sensitivity and component handling
- Environmental durability
- Electrostatic discharge (ESD) control

Masline’s IPC-compliant processes ensure customers receive only parts that conform to these quality expectations, reducing the risk of failures in end-use applications.
